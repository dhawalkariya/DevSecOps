Understanding the E2E Pipeline:

In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, the integration of security practices has become paramount. The concept of an end-to-end (E2E) pipeline represents a holistic approach to incorporating security seamlessly into the DevOps workflow. This approach not only streamlines the development process but also ensures that security measures are implemented at every stage, from conception to deployment. In this section, we will delve into the fundamental aspects of the E2E pipeline, exploring its significance in fortifying the DevOps process and ultimately enhancing the security posture of software applications.
